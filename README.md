# Project Name
Vehicle Damage Assessment

# Purpose
Car maintenance is really a hectic task when it comes to waiting for longer duration hence we can automate this task by recommending users based on their car condition

# Requirements
- Tensorflow
- Flask
- PIL
- matplotlib
- requests
- scipy
- torch
- pandas

# How to run this code
```
git clone https://github.com/Dhanushpoojary/Vehicle-Damage-Assessment-System
cd Vehicle-Damage-Assessment-System
python flask_app.py
open in localhost
```

# output
![val_batch2_labels](https://github.com/Gauthambhandary/Vehicle-Damage-Assessment-System/assets/76608448/113dc50b-c558-4aa6-80c7-545d59792b45)
